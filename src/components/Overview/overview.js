            <p>This course is part the series of software engineering workshops designed to teach students to work in teams and apply 
                their knowledge to solve real-life problems. This workshop will offer students the opportunity to concentrate on software requirements analysis 
                and design issues including artefacts produced as well techniques and tools to support this process (brainstorming, problem statements, 
                requirements elicitation, producing design documents and prototyping). In addition, it aims to provide students with some of the teamwork 
                skills, requirements engineering and design techniques that an engineer would use in the early stages of the development process. Sudents 
                will also be getting experience on different aspects of designing a Web application with a major focus on the front-end. The requirements for 
                this course will be determined in collaboration with industry partners and will relate to developing a realistic application.</p>
                
            <p>SENG2021 builds on the foundations of software engineering covered in COMP1531, and assumes that students are familiar with: the overall 
                process of software engineering, teamwork, version control systems, and databases.</p>
