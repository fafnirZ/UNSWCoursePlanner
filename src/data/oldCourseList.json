The course contextualises the science of acoustics, lighting and comfort within architectural design with an emphasis on environmental data collection, analysis and application to optimise IEQ and environmental performance. The role of architectural design in mitigating indoor and outdoor thermal comfort impacts is explored through real-world case-studies and parametric modelling. The significance of daylighting and artificial lighting design in IEQ and building environmental performance is investigated through the utilisation of numerical techniques and software applications. The appraisal and design of acoustic strategies to satisfy regulatory controls and optimise IEQ is supported through the application of acoustic principles to student\u2019s individual studio designs. At the completion of the course students will be able to identify, evaluate and apply strategies to optimise IEQ integrated with architectural design compliant with the regulatory standards applicable to environmental performance.</p>\n"

Every day, all over the world from small villages to entire regions, social, political, and economic changes take place in the name of local and global development. Yet, what is development and why does it matter? In this course we think of development as change; change driven by particular ideas about what a good life should be. Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. Other major changes come about through external factors:the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and forced migration, climate change and extreme weather events, amongst others. In this course we explore what drives development interventions, their impacts on communities, and the ways they respond. We explore also the processes and influences that operate at a global level and that impact such fundamental concerns as human rights, population health, environmental and climate change, and migration.</p>\n\n<p>Through a series of nine key topic areas that form the content of the course, you will learn why development thinking \u2013 and by extension development practice \u2013 has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learned from past failure and successes. You will be exposed to a variety of geographic case studies to see how development works (or doesn&#39;t) on the ground.

The processes of economic and political integration, heralded by the European Union, are under existential threat, and nationalism is on the rise. To the west, British disaffection with perceived loss of sovereignty has led to\u00a0a referendum passing\u00a0&#39;Brexit&#39;, indicating the intention of a member state to leave the EU for the first time. To its south, Europe is dealing with a refugee crisis brought on by wars in north Africa and the Middle East. On its Eastern flank, tensions with Russia are heightened, especially over Ukraine. The relationship of Europe with the USA in the era of Donald Trump&#39;s presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe&#39;s ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community. Europe pressingly seeks to reconcile its liberal and secular ideals with the competing demands of nationalism and religious fundamentalism.

How do we know a poem when we see it, and why is poetry the most moving, the most challenging, and the most memorable of literary forms? In this course you will encounter a range of accomplished and influential works from across the globe and across the centuries:from ravishing love poems to comic ballads, from hip hop to digital poetry. You will learn to think about such works in relation to their historical contexts, from political revolution to scientific developments. And you will discover new ways of thinking about poetry theoretically, from the significance of formal features such as voice and metre to the conceptual differences between poetry and other art forms such as music and the novel. The aim is to develop a thorough grounding in the history of poetry as a form, to hone your critical skills in analysing poetry, and to achieve a sophisticated grasp of contemporary debates about the nature and significance of poetry.</p>\n"

The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state.

Thus, in the course you will develop an understanding of how forms of social vulnerability to hazards emerge and shape subsequent disaster impacts. You will also examine how natural disasters are disruptive events that can critically jolt and shape future social, economic and political outcomes in the context of governance and politics. In the first half of the course you will examine different theories and frameworks for understanding disasters. This will provide a critical platform for the second part of the course, where you will focus on different thematic areas of disasters governance and society, using case study disasters from around the world.</p>\n"

To comprehend this, we will examine why masturbation suddenly became a very big \u2018problem\u2019 in the 18th century and why sex was increasingly regulated from the 19th century. We chart the growth of new forms of sexual knowledge and ponder feminist critiques of Freud and other sex \u2018experts\u2019. We wind up in the twentieth century, with not one but several sexual revolutions. The course is designed for students in Women\u2019s and Gender Studies and in History, but should appeal to anybody with an interest in one of the most studied and discussed aspects of modern life.</p>\n"

It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as &#39;converse&#39; with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen&#39;s literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers:her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism. Through these two lenses, the module demonstrates the continuing relevance of Austen&#39;s literary and moral worldview.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Subject Area:<em>Media, Culture and Technology</em></p>\n\n<p>Media, communication and the climate crisis have had a long, entangled relationship. Media and communications play key roles in the sciences of climate change themselves. For example, climate change sciences use computer modelling extensively, and also rely on global media networks that both circulate environmental data and allow for collaboration and discussion among scientists. Media and communication also play a role in bringing climate change science to the public. In the process, they help frame the way climate change is discussed. They thus play a fascinating if often conflicted series of roles in setting key social and political agendas with regard to climate change. On the other hand, dealing with climate change has challenged the way that media and communications work. The mainstream media has had to change its approach to what counts as news, and to the way it sets agendas. Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways. At the same time, newer media technologies such as social media and blogging platforms have augmented and often by-passed more traditional media platforms. This has transformed communications around environmental issues such as climate change. All this has created an increasingly complex setting both for the communication of science and for political communication around issues such as climate change. You will gain insight into the history, present and future of the increasingly important relations between media, communication and climate change. You will explore the ways in which climate change issues are taken up in media and communications theory, in everyday and working life, and in practices such as journalism, science, documentary making, online discussion and political communication.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n"

In less than half a century, a predominantly rural society has been transformed into a mainly urban and technological one. A 40-year dictatorship was supplanted by a strong, progressive democracy. One of the world&#39;s most centralised states has been made into one of the most decentralised. A society that was intensely sexually repressed has become a notably permissive one. There has been a revolution in the roles of men and women. Spain has experienced a surge in immigration that has turned the country, in the space of just a few years, into a multi-ethnic society. In this context of change, the topics explored in the course will include family, sexuality and gender, migration and ethnicity, identity, religion, animal rights, cultural appropriation, and popular culture.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The period from the early 1970s is often noted as a particularly volatile one for the global political economy (GPE). This volatility has significant implications for the ways in which we are able, or not, to live our lives today and for the future sustainability of political-economic practice. You will be asked in this course to work out what these implications are, and how they have arisen, by examining the global political economy in a variety of forms, and through multiple perspectives. You will be encouraged to think reflectively and imaginatively about questions in the GPE for which there are no easy answers, including questions of power, privilege, common sense, instability and the ongoing role of crisis-driven capitalist growth. You will be asked to make decisions about your views on the apparently systemic nature of capitalist instability. Together, we will decide to what extent, and why, the global political economy has been dominated by crisis, developing an understanding of the structure and practices of global political-economic relations, in historical and contemporary perspective.</p>\n"

If so, how should security studies scholars analyse them, and what are the implications for security praxis? How are policymakers dealing with these emerging or &#39;new&#39; security challenges, to what effect, and what are some of the alternatives? These are some of the key questions explored in this course, which investigates the broad and evolving agenda of security studies, and key themes and dynamics in contemporary security relations. Using a range of conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the course asks you to examine issues such as new forms of warfare, sexualized violence in armed conflict, migration and identity, food security, climate change, and nuclear proliferation, and question whether these constitute &#39;new&#39; security challenges. It asks what the implications of such an approach are for security relations at the state-societal level; the scholarly field of security studies, and the practice of security in policymaking terms. You are required to have a good level of familiarity with key security theories and concepts. If you are new to the sub-discipline of Security Studies you will need to do additional background reading as advised in the course outline or by the course convenor.</p>\n"

From the #metoo movement, to Black Lives Matter, to the Alt Right, to the Arab spring protests and\u00a0Occupy and Indignado movements:all around the world citizens are mobilising,\u00a0some because they want political change, others because they want to maintain the status quo.\u00a0What is change? Why do some people want radical and others moderate change?\u00a0What explains the success of advocates for non-change, i.e. the status quo? What <em>kind</em>\u00a0of change do political actors seek to achieve? In this course you will further explore these questions comparing processes of political change and actors involved in generating political change in Australia and other countries around the world. You will learn about the role of power, legitimacy, and insider and outsider positions in making political change work (or not). You will leave this course with a better understanding of what political change is, how it can be achieved, and what your own role can be in changing the world.\u00a0</p>"

You will be asked to think carefully about complex and intractable questions of identity, collectivity, social justice and governance. You will interrogate how identities are experienced politically, and in particular contexts, and will draw on particular examples from throughout the world to examine how various politics of identity, including the scholarly and public debates they have provoked, have emerged to challenge dominant ideas about social justice. How are identity and belonging shaped in the contemporary world? How do so-called nation-states engage, or not, with the political claims of oppressed social groups? Should citizenship still be the foundation for addressing identity claims in democracies? Does a nation-state have a right to protect its \u2018national identity\u2019 through restrictive immigration policies? What is the relationship between nationalism, race and sexuality?

    "description": "<p>The systematic study of politics has a long history, stretching back some two and a half thousand years to the ancient Greeks. Over the last century, however, it has become institutionalised and professionalised and, as the disciplinary name Political Science suggests, has sought to put the study of politics on a footing comparable to the aims, methods, and conventions presumed integral to the natural sciences. Yet the possibility, desirability, and even meaning of a \u201cscience of politics\u201d are controversial issues. This course examines fundamental questions about what political knowledge is and how it is acquired the &#39;art&#39;, craft of political science, that can be learned, practiced and improved over times.\u00a0This goal is achieved by reading and engaging in careful study of several seminar works in contemporary political science. In almost every week, we study a well designed and effectively executed research work as an example of how the &#39;art&#39; of political science is practiced in various branches of the discipline, including normative, formal and empirical studies.\u00a0</p>\n"

You will address the relationship between methods and methodology and recognise the importance of understanding the historical, theoretical and philosophical contexts from which particular research methods have emerged. Social researchers do not apply a set of neutral techniques to the issues they investigate, but rather research is part of a dynamic, engagement with social and cultural worlds with often deep connections to colonial thought and power. A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers:that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability. You will find that central to this course is the proposition that social research is a form of intervention in the social and cultural world, which may have major consequences on people\u2019s lives. So too you will develop an understanding of your \u2018subjective positioning\u2019 and will come to find ways to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies.

We will take into consideration current practice, particularly perceived problems, such as the alienating nature of many recent design projects. These prompt an inquiry into past principles that demand our attention now. Historical achievements are reinterpreted, with the aim of stimulating alternative design strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans are discussed, because their writings influenced designers in later epochs. A tradition of thinking about design stressed the significance of topics, such as order, proportion, analogy, symmetry, decorum, economy, ornament, the profile of mouldings, the angle of view, rhythmic measure, empathy, memory, monumentality and the play of light.</p>\n\n<p>Emphasis is placed on the analogy between a person and a design. This involves the theory of a human being as a \u2018type\u2019, whose constitution accords with built forms. Analysis of this accentuates human characteristics and actions, which are associated with privileged forms.

    "description": "<p>This course is a project-based course designed to build on the basic skills acquired in COMP3511 \u2013 Human Computer Interaction. The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application. </p>\n<p>The course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces.\u00a0</p>"

Many of these papers are written by or with former students in the course.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>It first presents the basic modelling and tools used in the market microstructure field which analyses how prices are established in securities markets and whether or not markets are liquid.

Topics include exchange design rules, transparency and opacity, asymmetric information, private information, liquidity provision and pricing, volatility, transaction costs, strategic and noise trading, algorithmic trading, information and trading profits, dark pools, liquidity and returns.

Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law:specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include:why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.<br /><br />Crime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above.

    "description": "<p>Legal Theory encourages students to take a <strong>reflective</strong> interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory.</p>\n\n<p>In the Western tradition this reflection starts with Aristotle\u2019s concept of <strong>Nomos</strong> which defined law as the \u201cprinciples and customs which <em>guide the whole way of life of a community</em>, including specific <em>commands and prohibitions</em>\u2026but also including accounts of the <em>nature of things </em>and <em>justifications of the law </em>itself?\u201d We can translate this description in four <strong>key questions</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul><li>What guides the life of the community (<strong>morality</strong>)?</li><li>What can be commanded as necessary or prohibited (<strong>power</strong>)?</li><li>What do we understand as the real nature of things (<strong>truth</strong>)?</li><li>What justifies the restrictions, judgements and force of law (<strong>legality</strong>)?</li></ul>\n\n<p>In other words, law refers to metaphysical concepts and very concrete human behaviour and social practices in our day to day lives:stopping for a red light even if no car is coming; paying taxes even if we disagree with the government. Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently:why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?</p>\n\n<p>Within the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are:Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law:moral and political philosophy. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.</p>\n"

For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?</p>\n<p><strong>Main Topics</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Introduction the problem of Law and Justice via an examination of Plato\u2019s Republic</li><li>Aristotle\u2019s theory of justice and its legacy (corrective and distributive justice; questions of justice requiring good judgment)</li><li>From theories of law and justice conceived in terms of natural law to natural rights and social contract theory (Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Kant and Rawls)</li><li>Non-contractualist theories of law and justice:Hume, the Utilitarians and particularly Hegel</li><li>Legal justice and justice as interpretation; Dworkin, and Gadamer</li><li>Marx\u2019s critique of all prevailing conceptions of legal rights, the rule of law and justice</li><li>Justice in a pluralist society; the just (secular) state; the just multicultural state and Global justice</li><li>The contemporary Frankfurt School\u2019s theories of law and justice in terms of theories of discourse and recognition.</li><li>Feminism, the ethic or care and the critique of legal justice</li><li>The post-structuralist deconstruction of law and justice</li></ul>"

Enrolment is by school consent, email:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:law&#64;unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">law&#64;unsw.edu.au</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>In their practical day-to-day activities, lawyers and citizens take, and must take, much for granted, both about society in which they work and live and about its legal order. Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society.\u00a0 Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them. Theoretical investigation looks beneath what we all too often take for granted, to see what accounts for it, how it works, and how it changes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Social theory is a particular way of asking theoretical questions, which tries to explain why things are as they are by examining the social practices and institutions that shape the way that people live.\u00a0 To study law and social theory is to explore theoretical issues that arise when we see law as one part of this broader social context.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some of the questions that we address in the course include:what social functions are played by legal systems, and the modern legal system in particular? How does law intersect with other social systems, practices, and forms of power?\u00a0 How, for example, is the legal system influenced by the economy, and how does it shape the economy in turn?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the legal system and political actors, such as the state, bureaucracy, classes and social movements?\u00a0 How does law shape, and how is it influenced by, socially dominant ways of thinking, such as ideology, rationality, or beliefs about class, gender, and race?\u00a0 What drives change in the legal system?\u00a0 Is it, for example, the practices of lawyers, politicians, or social movements?\u00a0 Is it the evolution of ideas? Or economic imperatives?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We will explore these questions in both an historical and contemporary context.\u00a0 We will examine the work of the foundational thinkers in the tradition of social theory, such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, who were responding to the massive social, economic, scientific and intellectual changes of the nineteenth century.\u00a0 Their work continues to provide insight into the relationship between law and society, because the contemporary world, has inherited many of the ideas and institutions that came to dominate society in their time, including the market economy, democracy, and liberal individualism.\u00a0 The course also engages with more contemporary theorists whose work responds to the changing social and legal landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 This may include the work of Michel Foucault, systems theory, feminist criticism, or theories of biopolitics.\u00a0 We will draw on these thinkers, not only to reflect on the themes of the course, but to think about pressing issues, such as the impact of neoliberalism and globalisation on the law, the treatment of refugees, emergency politics and constitutional democracy, and the legal and political response to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Studying theories of law and society will hopefully lead us beyond our original, and usually quite unreflective views of what is important in law, what role it plays in society, whose interests it serves, what causes legal change, and how important law is. In probing these questions, we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.</p>\n"

They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest. They also establish an international mechanism for adjudication and enforcement, allowing foreign investors to bypass national courts and, instead, bring cases against states directly to international arbitration. The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris\u2019 recent case against Australia arising from Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them.

In addition, given the influence and role of the United States in the world, American legal concepts, ideas and approaches are often borrowed or considered by non-American courts and legislatures as they develop their own law.

It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of privacy and intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, cybercrime, and the implications of advances in analytics, machine learning and autonomous systems.</p>\n<p>The interaction between traditional law and information technology plays a central role in the course. To analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale, while exploring its application to both novel and familiar scenarios arising from the ubiquity of digital technologies. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how the principles of personal information privacy can be adapted to a virtualised global setting; how emerging technologies can disrupt existing legal forms such as contracts or \u2018anonymous\u2019 data; and determining the appropriate models of liability and responsibility applicable to platforms based on eg, social media or AI.</p>\n<p>A statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course:\u201c[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world\u2019s technology to another.

Used well, legal information systems can facilitate access to legal information and expertise, but always within the limits of their designer&#39;s foresight.

    "uoc": "6",
    "term": "Term 2",
    "description": "<p>Most legal education in common law systems scrutinises the interpretation and development of the law via decisions made by courts in the process of litigation. This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact, only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation and there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of non-adjudicative dispute resolution.</p>\n<p>This course follows on from Resolving Civil Disputes, investigating and giving practical experience in a range of alternative forms of dispute resolution including negotiation, facilitation, mediation and group process. It requires students to identify and analyse examples of the interface between the outcomes of non-adjudicative dispute resolution processes and what might be termed &#39;black-letter law&#39; such as contract and revenue law.</p>\n<p>Dispute Resolution is delivered as a skills course. Whilst there will be some formal tuition, the focus of the course is on experiential learning. Skill training depends on a building block approach to learning whereby basic ideas are built upon through group discussion, preparation, performance and review.</p>\n<p>Because group dynamics and interaction play such an important part in the process, skills training works most effectively when it occurs in concentrated bursts of a day or more. For this reason, the course is delivered in full day sessions with an introductory lecture at the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Topics</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The taxonomy of ADR and introduction to the most commonly encountered processes</li><li>The influence of group dynamics on ADR processes</li><li>Tools from the Harvard Negotiation Program</li><li>Development of some &#39;rules of thumb&#39; which enhance the application of ADR principles in a group setting</li><li>Other influences on the ADR process such as behavioural preferences and communication styles</li><li>Communication in dispute resolution and developing a communication strategy</li><li>Various mediation role plays and debrief of case studies</li></ul>"

    "description": "<p>This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular, the relationship between the two in contemporary society. It begins by exploring the question \u201cwhat is justice\u201d? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?</p>\n<p><strong>Main Topics</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Introduction the problem of Law and Justice via an examination of Plato\u2019s Republic</li><li>Aristotle\u2019s theory of justice and its legacy (corrective and distributive justice; questions of justice requiring good judgment)</li><li>From theories of law and justice conceived in terms of natural law to natural rights and social contract theory (Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Kant and Rawls)</li><li>Non-contractualist theories of law and justice:Hume, the Utilitarians and particularly Hegel</li><li>Legal justice and justice as interpretation; Dworkin, and Gadamer</li><li>Marx\u2019s critique of all prevailing conceptions of legal rights, the rule of law and justice</li><li>Justice in a pluralist society; the just (secular) state; the just multicultural state and Global justice</li><li>The contemporary Frankfurt School\u2019s theories of law and justice in terms of theories of discourse and recognition.</li><li>Feminism, the ethic or care and the critique of legal justice</li><li>The post-structuralist deconstruction of law and justice</li></ul>"

    "description": "<p>Legal Theory encourages students to take a <strong>reflective</strong> interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory.</p>\n\n<p>In the Western tradition this reflection starts with Aristotle\u2019s concept of <strong>Nomos</strong> which defined law as the \u201cprinciples and customs which <em>guide the whole way of life of a community</em>, including specific <em>commands and prohibitions</em>\u2026but also including accounts of the <em>nature of things </em>and <em>justifications of the law </em>itself?\u201d We can translate this description in four <strong>key questions</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul><li>What guides the life of the community (<strong>morality</strong>)?</li><li>What can be commanded as necessary or prohibited (<strong>power</strong>)?</li><li>What do we understand as the real nature of things (<strong>truth</strong>)?</li><li>What justifies the restrictions, judgements and force of law (<strong>legality</strong>)?</li></ul>\n\n<p>In other words, law refers to metaphysical concepts and very concrete human behaviour and social practices in our day to day lives:stopping for a red light even if no car is coming; paying taxes even if we disagree with the government. Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently:why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?</p>\n\n<p>Within the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are:Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law:moral and political philosophy. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.</p>\n"

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society.\u00a0 Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them. Theoretical investigation looks beneath what we all too often take for granted, to see what accounts for it, how it works, and how it changes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Social theory is a particular way of asking theoretical questions, which tries to explain why things are as they are by examining the social practices and institutions that shape the way that people live.\u00a0 To study law and social theory is to explore theoretical issues that arise when we see law as one part of this broader social context.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some of the questions that we address in the course include:what social functions are played by legal systems, and the modern legal system in particular? How does law intersect with other social systems, practices, and forms of power?\u00a0 How, for example, is the legal system influenced by the economy, and how does it shape the economy in turn?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the legal system and political actors, such as the state, bureaucracy, classes and social movements?\u00a0 How does law shape, and how is it influenced by, socially dominant ways of thinking, such as ideology, rationality, or beliefs about class, gender, and race?\u00a0 What drives change in the legal system?\u00a0 Is it, for example, the practices of lawyers, politicians, or social movements?\u00a0 Is it the evolution of ideas? Or economic imperatives?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We will explore these questions in both an historical and contemporary context.\u00a0 We will examine the work of the foundational thinkers in the tradition of social theory, such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, who were responding to the massive social, economic, scientific and intellectual changes of the nineteenth century.\u00a0 Their work continues to provide insight into the relationship between law and society, because the contemporary world, has inherited many of the ideas and institutions that came to dominate society in their time, including the market economy, democracy, and liberal individualism.\u00a0 The course also engages with more contemporary theorists whose work responds to the changing social and legal landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 This may include the work of Michel Foucault, systems theory, feminist criticism, or theories of biopolitics.\u00a0 We will draw on these thinkers, not only to reflect on the themes of the course, but to think about pressing issues, such as the impact of neoliberalism and globalisation on the law, the treatment of refugees, emergency politics and constitutional democracy, and the legal and political response to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Studying theories of law and society will hopefully lead us beyond our original, and usually quite unreflective views of what is important in law, what role it plays in society, whose interests it serves, what causes legal change, and how important law is. In probing these questions, we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n"

The second part of the course examines criticisms of the link between constitutionalism and popular sovereignty that emerged in response to the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. These will include Marxist and anarchist claim that the state cannot realise popular self-determination and so needs to be eliminated through revolution, and the reactionary argument that democracy undermines law, order and morality. The final section of the course explores the radical democratic turn of critical theory since the 1970s and its tendency to critique law and rights while appropriating them for emancipatory politics. The course will situate these theories in their historical context and examine their contemporary relevance in the activities of existing social movements. Students will emerge from the course with a knowledge of theories of law and democracy that have shaped political history.\u00a0 They will also develop a critical understanding of the strengths and limitations of law and revolutionary politics as vehicles for realising democratic aspirations. </p>"

Professional services (of a B2B or B2C nature) are equally prominent and include legal services, financial planning, accountancy, architects, management consultancy, financial services, information technology, market research, and engineering services. Experiential services (tourism, sport, theatre) are also growing. However, it is important to remember that many product-based organisations (e.g., IBM, Federal Express) have a strong service component.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This course was developed because for business, in any industry, service provision is a key differentiator. The implications of service provision, and how services are best managed and marketed, are steadily gaining importance. Therefore, students who plan to work in service industries, or the customer service division of manufacturing industries, must be prepared sufficiently to do so. This course aims to help students understand the practical implications of the unique characteristics of services and service provision and to help them cope with the challenges of marketing and managing a service. To achieve this aim, we build upon, and expand, marketing management concepts and models, demonstrating how they apply to the services sector. This course focuses on the\u00a0distinctive characteristics and problems of marketing in service organizations and for any organization developing and marketing services as part of its business portfolio. It demonstrates why and how services require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy-both in its development and in its execution.

In MATH2501, you will review the material from first year, so that vector spaces and linear transformations become familiar friends rather than uneasy acquaintances. You will learn about geometric transformations:projections<br />\n(which can also be viewed as least squares approximations), rotations and reflections. You will see how to view many linear transformations as being made up of &#34;stretches&#34; in various directions, (the diagonalisation process), and the more general Jordan form.

The main analytical tools developed in this course can be thought of as generalisations of the Fourier and power series representations of functions studied in MATH2120. This leads to new types of functions and to practical methods for solving differential equations. We will pay special attention to functions defined on infinite domains.</p>\n\n<p>The course begins by characterising different partial differential equations (PDEs), and exploring similarity solutions and the method of characteristics to solve them. The Fourier transform, the natural extension of a Fourier series expansion is then investigated. For functions of time, the Fourier transform corresponds to the \u201cspectrum\u201d of the function or signal in the problem in the frequency domain. Closely related to the Fourier transform is the Laplace transform which is particularly useful for solving the initial value PDEs that arise in many physical applications. Although contour integration is an intrinsic part of using these transforms, only brief references to complex variable methods will be made.</p>\n\n<p>Transforms give a wide insight into the behaviour of a function and suggests other possibilities for the integral representation of solutions of PDEs. By exploiting certain special solutions of a given linear PDE we eventually obtain the idea of a Green&#39;s function for the PDE and a corresponding integral form for the solution. The power of Green&#39;s functions can be observed in their use as the inverses of differential operators on both infinite and bounded domains.</p>\n\n<p>Frequently it is not possible to evaluate in closed form the Fourier, Laplace or Green\u2019s function integrals appearing in the solution of the given PDE.

This means mastering skills in and developing a critical approach to audio, visual and verbal forms of journalistic production. By experimenting with visual and audio storytelling, the specific aim of this course is to produce material ready for radio- and television-style news items. Special attention is given to new forms and styles of journalism emerging on the internet, where audio, visual, verbal and interactive elements combine in innovative ways to tell newsworthy multi-semiotic stories. As journalist, videographer, sound engineer, producer and editor, future journalists need to display greater flexibility and a degree of experimentation in their news gathering practices. This course provides students with the opportunity to develop these skills, and to add value to the information they gather, both in terms of producing compelling stories and in experimenting with multiplatform news gathering and dissemination practices.</p>\n"

But communication is never as clear-cut as that. Something as seemingly-straightforward as &#39;writing&#39; in fact has a visual component (how it looks), and a material component (what it is produced on and with). And we also communicate through many other modes - such as through the design of objects and buildings, the sorts of networks we create through digital media, or the actions we undertake in daily life. In this course, you will extend your understanding of communication by investigating underlying principles of communication design, the range of modes we communicate with, and the complex nature of all forms of communication. We will investigate particular modes in depth, and explore how they work together. You will develop research skills which allow you to critique and evaluate the design of multimodal communication, especially in terms of its contribution to contemporary society.</p>\n"

The following description refers to the areas of study students will encounter upon completion of both courses. Depending upon the year of enrolment, the exact content allocated to either component will vary.</p>\n<p>Objectives:- To gain an understanding of the particular health issues that arise in elders, building upon learning done in previous courses. The themes are menopause; the ageing process; degenerative diseases; and death, dying and palliative care.</p>\n<p>In one of the two years, breast cancer and neurological disease will be used to explore these themes. Students will study the structure and function of the brain and central nervous system, and the pathology of stroke, dementia and neoplasia. Relevant aspects of public health, including clinical epidemiology and community resources will be explored, whilst learning of clinical skills will involve examination of the central nervous system and breast examination. In the other year, the focus will shift to the peripheral nervous system and musculoskeletal system, including the cellular and molecular aspects of nerve transmission, membrane physiology and relevant pharmacology. The biological, psychological and behavioural aspects of pain will be used as an integrating concept to link many of these topics. Clinical skills will focus on examination of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nervous system. A second major topic area will be further study of neoplasia, focusing on colorectal cancer.</p>\n<p>A series of learning activities focusing on communication skills and clinical communication operates throughout phase 1 of the Medicine program. It involves learning within clinical environments and will be integrated with content topics specific to individual courses.</p>\n<p>Assessment will involve performance in two projects/assignments and an end of course written examination.</p>"

Clinical tutors and communication skills tutors will provide an integrated approach to teaching these skills. The teaching of basic communication skills will be addressed in simulated clinical consultations to ensure that the relevance of generic skills is understood within the context of medical practice. These simulated consultations will also be used to address concepts of the medical history and the patient-centred approach. Existing anatomical models and graphics will be used to introduce concepts of surface anatomy and functional anatomy underpinning the physical examination. Similarly, the relevance of normal physiology to the physical examination will be addressed.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to attend all sessions and to have completed preparatory activities. The students will be expected to reach a satisfactory level of performance based on continuous assessment in simulated clinical consultations.

Skills relating to problem solving, research, team working, and project planning and basic management will developed to standards expected of graduates entering the workplace - students are then expected to utilise and build on these skills in their final year to provide them with high-level skills that will make them sought after in the employment market.<br /> <br /> Despite their non-technical nature, the concepts involved in this course are just as challenging as those that are involved in the technical analyses with which most engineering students are more familiar. A professional engineer can expect to find herself or himself working on several memos, reports and presentations at any given time - it is an essential part of performing effectively in industry. Therefore many tasks will be undertaken, some short and relatively simple, with others more complex and nuanced, partly reflecting the timelines and pressures of the working environment and providing an opportunity to work in different teams on different tasks. Analysis of team structures and interpersonal communication also forms part of the course, as aspects of teamwork such as leadership, conflict resolution, managing differing technical skill levels and cultural backgrounds are vital in professional practice and must be appreciated as useful skills for the engineer.<br /> <br /> The centrepiece of the course is a group research project on an area pertinent to modern engineering. This, along with guest lectures from industry professionals will be used to provide insight into the working relationships between professional engineers, clients and management in order to prepare students for the workforce.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Music is part of the life of people everywhere, and as George Eliot once said, there is no feeling, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find relief in music. Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world\u2019s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?</p>\n\n<p>This World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe. It examines how musical practices express, shape, and allow for the individual and collective construction and negotiation of identity, ethnicity, gender, spirituality and class. It investigates how transformations in music both as social practice and as sound chart responses to modernity, state intervention, globalisation, conflict, dispossession and migration. The course also fosters direct experience of music in diverse cultural contexts through field work.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Most of us have experienced those magic moments when sounds and rhythms (grooves) move the body and set in motion interactions between musicians, dancers and audiences. But what do musicians do with their bodies, voices and instruments to get other bodies toe-tapping, dancing, or moshing? How do musicians and listeners become one, a communion, or a rite? We begin to answer these questions with the understanding that musical sound is a powerful force for social interaction (grooves, in a broader sense). At the same time, we address these questions with the understanding that here is no simple relationship between what musicians produce and the social and cultural meanings ascribed to their productions. Popular music may also be considered as a cultural text that is read, received, and interpreted by both individuals and groups.</p>\n\n<p>This course covers a wide variety of popular musics, ranging from the locally produced to the latest global trends, through a survey of the historical and social development of key genres, such as, blues, country, reggae, rock and roll, Motown, soul, hard rock, disco, hardcore, metal, grunge, techno, rap and Latin forms.

Beginning with African American chants, field hollers, early blues and urban dance forms, this course traces a history of the music, outlining the development and details of various styles of jazz, both in the United States and abroad. Tracing the changing locations in which the music has developed, it examines the roles of individual artists and musical collectivities in the innovation of styles. It investigates the dissemination of jazz through emerging media technologies, and notes the influence of other music on jazz musicians:popular music, rhythm and blues, soul, rock, classical music and world music, such as Latin American music, French gypsy music, South African kwela and mbqanga. As jazz has become the scintillating soundtrack to many lives, the course examines both the practical use of jazz as sound and image in film, literature and the visual arts, and some of the many meanings listeners have ascribed to it. The course introduces\u00a0you\u00a0to critical debates surrounding jazz:debates of race, authenticity, ownership, gender and commercialization.

Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest, safest and simplest way to reduce emissions. This course covers the various methodologies, technologies and policies that can be used to reduce energy use, while still producing what that energy is needed for - heat, light and movement.Topics covered include current and predicted energy use and associated GHG emissions; residential and commercial passive solar design; energy management programs; building management systems; heating, ventilation and air conditioning; and consumer products and office equipment. The impacts of transport are also covered, together with opportunities to reduce transport energy requirements through more efficient engines, public transport, and urban design. Industrial systems examined include heat recovery; cogeneration; compressed air and steam distribution; and motor systems, pumps and fans. Efficient use of water, and increased efficiency of water supply can also significantly reduce energy use. Various government policy measures at the local, state, commonwealth and international level are covered in terms of their effectiveness and relevance in Australia. Finally, barriers to improved energy efficiency such as up-front cost, lack of information, and the low cost of energy in Australia are examined.Assignments focus on energy use and emissions produced at your home and by your transport to and from the UNSW, and will also analyse current energy practices at the UNSW.</p>"

The course commences with some general law (non-tax) coverage of each entity, especially material factors in regard to the choice of entity question. It then moves to the income tax rules for each entity. Here the focus is on the tax rules relevant to the creation, operation and termination of partnerships, trusts and companies. The focus is on the tax rules that apply to closely held entities, and not widely held entities like listed trusts and listed companies.</p>"
