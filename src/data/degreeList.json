One of those expectations is that they should display leadership, particularly when they are shaping public policy. Very little scholarly study is, however, focused on the particular challenges of public leadership, or the relationship between public leadership and policy formulation. The Doctor of Public Leadership uniquely addresses this gap by offering students a combination of courses focused specifically on public leadership and policy alongside a rich selection of electives addressing broader issues related to national and global policy, and leadership. This combines with a focused and directed workplace-based research thesis that builds on the coursework platform to develop new knowledge in this critically important field.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to similar programs focusing mainly on public administration, management and supervision, this program will be the first to concentrate specifically on exercising and enriching leadership in professional contexts ranging from government departments and statutory authorities, educational bodies and training authorities, media organisations and advocacy groups, defence and security services.</p>\n\n<p>The Doctor of Public Leadership is ideal for those who are in, or seeking to attain, positions of public leadership, as well as postgraduate scholars seeking to develop a research competence in this field.

Applicants are employer-employee pairs where the employer has identified you as a future health leader in whom they want to invest for the benefit of the workplace. UNSW works with the employer employee pair to ensure the program and the professional doctorate reflect the needs and skills development required by both parties.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally higher degrees have focused on ensuring the development of research and critical thinking skills in individuals. Professional doctorates do the same, but reflect health practice in the workplace and also incorporate real time, real work benefits for candidates and employers. Because your research focuses on your workplace, you receive the benefit of being able to integrate your studies into your day-to-day work.</p>\n\n<p>The UNSW Future Leaders Program provides an opportunity for strengthening health leadership capacity within the organization through you, the future leader. During this program you will have access to regular workshops, during which you will learn how to plan and undertake research and evaluation projects, skills which you will immediately put into use in your organisation. Research shows that staff members who feel engaged and supported are more likely to remain with their employers. So the benefits for you and your organisation are that you will develop your skills to a higher level and be able to directly contribute your growing expertise and experience to your organisation while you learn.

Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.<br />\n<br />\nThe development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.<br />\n<br />\nMicroorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests.

Four years of full-time study leads to the award of a Bachelor of Exercise Physiology. A total of 192 units of credit must be successfully completed for the award of this degree. Graduates may expect to find employment as Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEP) in rehabilitation clinics and hospitals working in post-acute rehabilitation, sports medicine clinics, corporate health, specialised fitness centres, and private practice for rehabilitation/exercise prescription for people requiring specialist guidance (e.g. workplace rehabilitation). The Bachelor of Exercise Physiology is accredited by the national governing body, Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA). Graduates are eligible to become members of ESSA and practice as Accredited Exercise Physiologists and\u00a0Accredited Exercise Scientists.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>Foundation science courses\u00a0are an important component of the early stages of the program and include chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, statistics and psychology. Building on this knowledge base, the medical sciences of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology are studied concurrently with the exercise science sub-disciplines of biomechanics, motor control and exercise psychology - leading to an integrated understanding of human function in health and disease and how this is impacted by exercise. The professional role of Exercise Physiologists is emphasised from the commencement of the program in Stage 1 exercise science courses. Clinical courses in Stage 3 cover the four broad areas of practice for Exercise Physiologists being, 1) the primary prevention of disease in apparently healthy populations, 2) the management of chronic diseases under the broad categories of cardiopulmonary and metabolic conditions, 3) musculoskeletal conditions and work hardening and 4) neuromuscular conditions. Courses offer a mixture of traditional and interactive/case study approaches to learning.</p>\n\n<p>Students are required to complete a minimum of 12 UOC of research courses in their final year.

The profession of Civil Engineering was recognized by the formation of the Institution of Civil Engineers (UK) in 1825. In the 19th Century, the broadening scope of engineering led to the division of civilian engineering into civil, mechanical and electrical, with further specializations (aeronautical, chemical, industrial, materials, electronic etc.) having developed in the 20th Century.</p>\n\n<p>After contracting its sphere of interest over a long period of time, Civil Engineering is now broadening its scope with the recognition of the wider implications of its effects on modern society. Attention is given both to the interaction between civil engineering and other disciplines and to the effect of Civil Engineering works on the environment. Present day civil engineering has maintained strong commonality with military engineering - the design and construction of facilities such as roads, bridges, airfields, buildings, water supply and waste treatment facilities, structures of all types, and the associated planning and management of projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>Engineering degrees offered by UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.</p>\n\n<p>The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering program is of four years duration and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II.

It became a separate branch of engineering in the early 1800s, when steam power began to be used in manufacture and transportation.</p>\n\n<p>One can identify four functions that are common to all branches of mechanical engineering.</p>\n\n<p>The first is the understanding of and dealing with the bases of mechanical science. These include dynamics, concerning the relationship between forces and motion, such as vibration; automatic control:thermodynamics, dealing with the relations among the various forms of heat, energy, and power; fluid flow; heat transfer; lubrication; and properties of materials.</p>\n\n<p>Second is the sequence of research, design, and development. This function attempts to bring about the changes necessary to meet present and future needs. Such work requires not only a clear understanding of mechanical science and an ability to analyse a complex system into its basic factors, but also the originality to synthesise and invent.</p>\n\n<p>Third is production of products and power, which embraces planning, operation and maintenance. The goal is to produce the maximum value with the minimum investment and cost while maintaining or enhancing longer term viability of the enterprise or the institution.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth is the co-ordinating function of the mechanical engineer, including management, consulting and, in some cases, marketing.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these functions there is a long continuing trend towards the use of scientific instead of traditional or intuitive methods. Operations research, value engineering and reliability centred maintenance are typical titles of such new rationalised approaches. Creativity, however, cannot be rationalised. The ability to take the important and unexpected step that opens up new solutions remains in mechanical engineering, as elsewhere, largely a personal and spontaneous characteristic.</p>\n\n<p>(The above description was adapted from the Encyclopedia Britannica).</p>\n\n<p>Except for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Honours Program first-year engineering and technology students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses.

Such conflict is the definition of irregular warfare, yet this type of warfare is not well addressed within academia.\u00a0Within these conflicts, the employment of special operations forces has been seen on an unprecedented scale, yet special operations also remains an understudied and often misunderstood instrument of military policy. The Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare uniquely addresses this gap by offering students a combination of special operations focused core courses, irregular warfare focused core courses and a selection of electives addressing broader issues in strategy and security. This combination provides the student both a focused view of the phenomenon of special operations and irregular warfare and a broad understanding of their context. The Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare is ideal for military personnel seeking to broaden their understanding of\u00a0those forms of warfare that exist to challenge conventionally-orientated militaries. The program also provides an excellent framework of reference for other government employees and contractors who require a good understanding of Special Operations and Irregular threats. Postgraduate scholars seeking to develop a research competence in this field will also find in the Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare a valuable foundation.</p>\n"},
