The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology &amp; Automation.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the &#39;big picture&#39; as well as &#39;the specific details&#39;. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.<br />\n<br />\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management."},

Research, focusing on the development of existing theories or the creation of new ones, may be driven by applications or by the internal demands of the discipline. Pure Mathematics courses provide the insights and understanding required by those using mathematics, leading to mastery of the fundamental processes of mathematical science and the capacity for innovative applications in any area.</p>\n\n<p><em>Applied Mathematics</em> concerns the development of mathematics and models for understanding scientific phenomena, for the solution of technical and industrial problems, and for use in the social, economic and management sciences. Courses are designed to provide basic mathematical and computational skills needed for a wide range of applications, to develop the capability to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, and to encourage enthusiasm for the role of the mathematician in a variety of contexts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Statistics</em> is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for a major in Mathematics for Education as part of a concurrent Bachelor of Science / Bachelor of Education program (4076). Only students enrolled concurrently in both a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education program may take this major. The major ensures that students meet all accreditation requirements with the NSW Institute of Teachers.</p>\n"},

These fascinating organisms impact on our lives in many ways. On the negative side, they cause disease in humans, animals and plants, and they spoil our food. However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of organic carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action. The genetic engineering of microorganisms is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology and the way of the future.<br />\n<br />\nA major in Medical Microbiology is only available to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Medical Science program."},

Thus solutions to health problems often lie outside the health system - in social policy, urban design, community cohesion, personal relationships, and the penal system, to name but a few. The Master of Public Health stream in Social Research provides students with training in sociological conceptualisations of health and in approaches to health issues using both quantitative/epidemiological and qualitative/interpretive methods. It consists of core MPH courses, with a stream-defining course on sociological approaches to public health, two research methodology courses, and a selection of either an SPHCM elective, project, internship or independent studies. The stream is taught by staff with a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds including sociology, psychology, political science, anthropology, ethnography and epidemiology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who should do this stream?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This MPH degree focuses on the social aspects of health and social approaches to addressing public health problems. You may be a social science graduate seeking training in public health research skills, or a public health or healthcare practitioner wanting to develop your understanding of social influences on health and illness.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in carrying out research, the degree provides a clear pathway towards further academic research training (e.g. a PhD) or research in the workplace (government policy, program evaluation etc.). Graduates from this stream develop the knowledge and skills to enter postgraduate research degrees that require expertise in either social epidemiology or qualitative research, or both.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for anyone who wants to change public health and health policy for the better - even when change means political action or social change outside the healthcare system. Much medical and health research does not make a difference, because it stays in the medical journals.

Sustainable forms of energy are of priority in the modern world. Geothermal energy is one of the sustainable forms energy where the heat energy generated and stored in Earth are applied. More than 90 countries in the world have proven Geothermal energy resources. Recently, there has been significant investment in this resource globally. Australia and New Zealand also have enormous Geothermal resources. The exploitation of these resources has a large overlap with Petroleum Engineering methods including reservoir characterization and drilling methods. However, there is a need for extra research for the familiarity of students with these resources at an advanced level.<br />\n<br />\nFurther, today&#39;s leaders in energy disciplines need to be able to move from the existing body of knowledge in the profession to develop new and innovative solutions to problems covering the technical aspects of earth exploration and development, to project economics, and to the environmental and social context of the industry. Therefore, the stream includes a range of courses with a research or enquiry-based learning component.
